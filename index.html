    <h3>Stock Average Calculator</h3>
    <h4>What is a Stock Average Calculator?</h4>
    <p>A Stock Average Calculator is a financial tool used to calculate the average price of a stock or a portfolio of stocks. It helps investors to determine the average cost of their investments, which is essential for making informed decisions about buying and selling stocks.</p>
    <h4>How does a Stock Average Calculator work?</h4>
    <p>A Stock Average Calculator works by taking into account the total amount invested in a stock or a portfolio of stocks, the number of shares purchased, and the price at which they were purchased. The calculator then calculates the average price of the stock or portfolio, which is the total amount invested divided by the number of shares.</p>
    <h4>How to use a Stock Average Calculator?</h4>
    <p>Using a Stock Average Calculator is straightforward. Here are the steps:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Enter the number of shares purchased</li>
      <li>Enter the price at which the shares were purchased</li>
      <li>Click the "Calculate" button to get the average price</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Example:</h4>
    <p>Let's say you purchased 100 shares of XYZ stock at 50 per share, and then purchased another 200 shares at 60 per share. To calculate the average price of your investment, you would:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Enter 100 (total number of shares) in the first "Number of Shares" field</li>
      <li>Enter 50 "Price" fields</li>
      <li>Enter 200 (total number of shares) in the second "Number of Shares" field</li>
      <li>Enter 60 "Price" fields</li>
      <li>Click the "Calculate" button to get the average price</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The calculator would then display the average price of your investment, which in this case would be 56.66 per share.</p>
